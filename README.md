# CIBMTR EQUITY-IN-POST-HEMATOPOIETIC-CELL-TRANSPLANTATION-HCT-SURVIVAL-PREDICTIONS
## Overview
To develop models to improve prediction of transplant survival rates equitably for allogeneic HCT patients, that every patient has a fair chance at a successful outcome, regardless of their background.

## Description
**Healthcare Challenge:** Address disparities in survival predictions for allogeneic HCT patients related to socioeconomic status, race, and geography.

**Goal:** Enhance patient care, optimize resource utilization, and rebuild trust in the healthcare system.

**Objectives:**

- Develop predictive models that are accurate and fair across diverse patient groups.

- Address disparities by integrating diverse data sources and refining algorithms.

- Reduce biases to ensure equitable outcomes for patients of different races.

**Data:** Synthetic data simulating real-world conditions while protecting patient privacy.

**Outcome:** Create a fairer and more effective healthcare system where every patient receives equitable care.
